Conventional movie recommendation systems often struggle to provide accurate recommendations due to their inability to analyze vast amounts of movie content and their lack of consideration for user preferences. These limitations result in challenges when suggesting movies that genuinely align with user interests.

In this project, we focus on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a 10,000-movie recommendation dataset. The dataset includes various attributes such as movie title, release date, description, rating, popularity, and language. Before performing analysis, thorough data cleaning and preprocessing are essential, along with feature extraction to enhance the dataset’s usability. Given the large dataset size, a structured approach is necessary to understand feature relationships, identify patterns, and uncover trends.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is titled "TMDB Movies Dataset" and contains movies up to July 26, 2022, featuring the top 10,000 highest-rated movies on TMDB. The insights derived from this dataset will facilitate the development of a machine learning model for movie recommendations. Additionally, with movies spanning multiple languages, the dataset can help predict a film’s potential success in the industry based on historical trends. The findings from this project can serve as a valuable reference for future movie-related studies and applications.
