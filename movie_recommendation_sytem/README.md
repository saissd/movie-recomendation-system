# Advanced_movie_recommendation_sytem

The incapability of analysing a huge quantity of movie content and the lack of constraints imposed by not understanding the end user's preferences make conventional movie recommendation systems essentially fail to deliver accurate recommendations. They will frequently face challenges in providing users with authentic movies for the reasons mentioned. Here our model deals with explanation of data cleaning and Exploratory data analysis done on 10,000 movie recommendation dataset. The dataset contains diverse attributes like movie name, release date, description, rating, popularity, language etc. But before analyzing the data, the dataset must be cleaned and pre-processed. And also feature extraction should be done. Considering the huge volume of dataset, a structured approach is required to understand the relationships between the features. The task is to make the dataset suitable for exploratory data analysis to find patterns and trends. The dataset is extracted from Kaggle platform. It is titled as “TMDB Movies Dataset” and contains movies till 26-July-2022. These are top 10,000 movies rated TMDB platform. This dataset will enable us to build a machine learning model which recommends movies. Given the dataset has movies from diverse languages, it can also predict the success factor for a movie in the industry based on the history. The insights that can be gained from the project can help as a future reference in movie related projects.
